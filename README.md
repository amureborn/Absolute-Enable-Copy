# How I Built This Extension!

Before starting the actual development of the 'Absolute Enable Copy & Image Reader' Chrome extension, we first need to understand what a Chrome extension is. Chrome extensions are small tools or software pieces that can be installed in browsers to add extra features, enhancing our browsing experience.

To make a simple extension you need simple web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with some knowledge of web development. You will be pleased to know that our straightforward "Absolute Enable Copy & Image Reader" Chrome extension is built using these technologies.

Creating a Chrome extension is similar to creating a web application, but it requires a manifest.json file which we will discuss in this post.
